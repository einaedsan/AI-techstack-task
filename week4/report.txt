HOG was used to extract edge and texture features from images. A Decision Tree was trained for classification using these features.

Test Accuracy: 0.8618

Dataset split:
80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing, with a stratified split to ensure that both classes 
(cats and dogs) are balanced in each set.

Improvements:

Increasing the number of images or using data augmentation can improve accuracy.


 Summary of learnings from HOG and Decision Tree

HOG:

Extracts local features such as edges and orientations.
Works well on small grayscale images but is sensitive to background and pose variations.

Decision Tree:

Simple and interpretable, but can overfit when the dataset is small or features are complex.
Setting depth limits and minimum samples per leaf helps improve performance.
