The images Baby, Diana, and Snowman were resized using the Seam Carving algorithm to reduce width.

For each image, a specified number of columns (e.g., 200) were removed while preserving important content.

Low-energy seams were found using Dynamic Programming and removed one by one.

Seam visualization was enabled to observe the removal process step by step.(when you run the code)

Energy Function:

Base energy was computed using the image gradient (Sobel filter).

When available, Depth Maps and Saliency Maps were added to the base energy to protect important areas:
E
Total
=E
gradient

+E
depth

+E
saliency
	â€‹

Observations (Visual Quality):

Key content such as faces or characters was preserved with minimal distortion.

Less important regions were removed, resulting in balanced resized images.

Using Depth and Saliency Maps prevented seams from passing through critical areas, improving visual quality.
